How HolyArrs scores a subtitle, when it searches, and how each Subtitle site behaves.

For setup, see [Subtitles](subtitles.md).

## Change the Pass mark

A search saves a subtitle by itself only at or above the Pass mark. A hand choice may have any score.

1. Open **Settings > Subtitles**.
2. Set the Pass mark for episodes and for movies, each from 0 to 100.
3. Click **Save**. You should see the new marks used the next time a search runs.

A lower mark takes looser matches, which are more often out of time. A higher mark waits longer for a close match. Defaults are 90 for episodes and 70 for movies.

## What the score counts

Each subtitle gets 0 to 100 points for:

- the right name and year, and for an episode the right season and episode,
- the same release group, source, resolution, video codec, audio and edition as your file,
- the hearing-impaired and forced choice you asked for,
- a trusted uploader,
- a frame rate hint, worth 1 point. HolyArrs does not measure your video's frame rate, so this rarely adds anything.

A subtitle for another title, year, season or episode scores 0.

## Subtitle sites

Sites are asked lowest priority number first.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **On** | Asked on every search. |
| **Paused** | You paused it. Click **Turn on** to bring it back. |
| **Resting until** | It failed. HolyArrs tries again after that time. |
| **Needs your account** | It will not run until you fill in your details. |

**Test** runs one search for a known title. A failed test never pauses the site.

:::caution
Some sites only work with your own account. Account details are stored encrypted and never shown again. Leave the fields empty when you edit the site to keep the stored ones. Moving the site to another address asks for them again. Removing the site forgets them. They never appear in the log, in Events or in error messages.
:::

## If it does not work

**Symptom:** a site says **Resting until**.
**Cause:** it failed. The rest time depends on why, see How long a site rests below.
**Fix:** wait, or fix your account details and save. Saving turns the site back on.

**Symptom:** a site says **Needs your account**.
**Fix:** open the site and fill in the details it asks for.

**Symptom:** a test fails.
**Cause:** the account details are wrong or the site is down. A failed test never pauses the site.

## For experts

<details class="ha-more"><summary>When HolyArrs searches</summary>

| Trigger | Default | Range |
|---|---|---|
| New file, from an import or a better copy | searched at once | |
| Files still missing a subtitle | every 6 hours | 1 to 168 hours |
| **Files per run, at most** | 100 | 1 to 1000 |
| **Slow down after three weeks** | On: not found in 3 weeks, then searched once a week | On or Off |
| **Look for better subtitles** | On: every 12 hours, subtitles saved in the last 7 days that scored under 99 | every 6 to 168 hours, age 0 to 30 days |

A better subtitle must score higher than the one it replaces.

<details class="ha-more"><summary>Sites and accounts</summary>

| Site | Covers | Account | Notes |

| Gestdown | shows | none | Show subtitles from Addic7ed. |
