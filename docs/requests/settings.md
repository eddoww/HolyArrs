title: Weekly limits and Request rules
description: Set how much each person can ask for and where approved titles go.
level: Setup
---

Limit how much people ask for and set where approved titles go. Only the owner and admins change these.

Open **Settings > Request rules** (`http://your-server:6262/settings/requests`).

## Set weekly limits

1. Under **Weekly limits**, set the number for movies, shows and music.
2. Save.

Each limit covers a rolling 7 days and counts one kind only. Approvers have no limit.

| Limit | Default | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Movies | 10 | 0 to 1000, 0 = no limit |
| Shows | 10 | 0 to 1000, 0 = no limit |
| Music | 10 | 0 to 1000, 0 = no limit |

## Choices

### One person's own limit

Open **Settings > Users and roles**, change the person and set their weekly asks. An empty box uses the default.

### Where approved titles go

These apply when an approver leaves folder or quality on **Default**.

| Setting | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Movie folder**, **Movie quality** | Folder and quality rules for approved movies | First movie Library folder, and that folder's quality |
| **Show folder**, **Show quality** | The same for shows | First show Library folder, and that folder's quality |
| **Music folder**, **Music quality** | The same for artists and albums | First music Library folder, and that folder's quality |
| **Search when approved** | Search as soon as a request is approved. Movies at once, shows at the next feed check | On |

### Where 4K requests go

A 4K request always uses the 4K settings, whatever the approver picks.

| Setting | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **4K movie folder**, **4K movie quality** | Folder and Pick rules of the copy an approved 4K movie request adds | The movie's own folder, and the Pick rules named 4K |
| **4K show folder**, **4K show quality** | The same for shows | The show's own folder, and the Pick rules named 4K |

A title a 4K request adds gets a Version named **4K**, so later 4K requests find it.

## If it does not work

**Symptom:** saving fails on a limit.
**Cause:** the value is outside 0 to 1000.

**Symptom:** someone still hits a limit after you raised it.
**Cause:** they have their own limit. **Fix:** clear it in **Settings > Users and roles**.
