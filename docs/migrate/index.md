Bring your old apps' setup into HolyArrs without typing it again.

HolyArrs only reads the old apps. Nothing in them changes, and your media files never move.

## Before you start

- Sign in as the owner or an admin.
- Have each old app's address and API key ready.
- Make sure HolyArrs can see your media folders. See [Folders and hardlinks](../start/folders.md).

## Move your setup

1. Open **Settings > Move from other apps**. You should see five steps in a row at the top.
2. **Read:** click **Add an app** for each old app. You should see each app listed with a switch.
3. **Choose:** turn on the groups you want to bring over.
4. **Try it:** check what will be added. Nothing changes yet.
5. **Move:** click **Move** and confirm. You can leave the page while it runs.
6. **Done:** you should see the results per group and **Undo this move**.

Keys and passwords never come over. See [After the move](#after-the-move).

## Order to do it

| Order | App | Why this order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Radarr, Sonarr | Library folders and titles come first. See [Sonarr and Radarr](sonarr-radarr.md). |
| 2 | Lidarr, Prowlarr, Bazarr | Music, Sources and subtitle languages. See [Lidarr, Bazarr and Prowlarr](lidarr-bazarr-prowlarr.md). |
| 3 | qBittorrent, SABnzbd | Downloaders. Read them in the same move as the apps above. |
| 4 | Seerr, Overseerr | People and requests, matched to titles already here. See [Request apps](requests-apps.md). |

You can read every app and move them all at once. The order matters only if you move in batches.

## After the move

Each item below comes over paused or off. Type its secret, check it, then turn it on.

| Item | Where | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sources | **Settings > Sources** | Type the key, then resume. |
| Downloaders | **Settings > Downloaders** | Type the password or key, then resume. |
| Alerts | **Settings > Alerts** | Type the link or mail password, then turn on. |
| Outside lists | **Settings > Outside lists** | Check folder and Pick rules, then turn on. A Trakt list needs your Trakt key first. |
| People | **Settings > Users and roles** | Send invites. |

A Source, Downloader or Alert that had tags in the old app now serves every title of its kind. Check it before you turn it on.

Sources and Downloaders arrive with **May reach the local network** off. Turn it on only for one on your home network. Link-local and cloud metadata addresses stay blocked either way.

To type many keys at once, see [Import keys from a file](import-secrets.md).

## What stays behind

- **Media files.** The move never moves, renames, copies or deletes a file.
- **Keys, passwords, tokens and cookies.** The Move step and the report list each under **Keys to type again**.
- **Settings with no match here.** Each one is on the **not moved** list with its reason.
- **History.** The old apps' history is not read. The person who asked for a title does come over.

## If it does not work

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Titles show as not found | Their folder does not match a Library folder here. | Add a path rule under **Advanced** in **Choose**, then move again. |
| Move says the plan changed | Something changed since the test. | Run **Try it** again, then move. |
| The move button is greyed out | A person needs a choice, or HolyArrs is in safe mode. | Read the text next to the button. |
| Some items failed | For example, the metadata server was down. | Wait, then move again. Your old-app keys are kept. |

## For experts

<details class="ha-more"><summary>Move again, undo, parts and safe mode</summary>

**Move again.** A move remembers what it added. Moving again adds only what is new and says **already here** for the rest. One move or undo runs at a time. If HolyArrs stops mid-move, the move is marked failed at the next start, or resumes if its job is still queued. It never blocks the next move.

**Earlier moves**, under the reads, lists every move and its state. **Open** shows a move at step 5, or step 4 while it runs.

**Undo.** Click **Undo this move** at step 5 (for an older move, **Open** it first). The undo runs in the background and removes only what that move added, newest first:

- titles leave the Library; their files stay where they are,
- Sources, Downloaders, Alerts, subtitle sites, people, requests and Never-add entries it added are removed,
- Outside lists it added are removed while still paused,
- naming, default subtitle languages and waits on Pick rules go back to what they were.

What you set up or changed after the move stays, and the undo report lists it: a secret you typed, a person or Outside list you turned on, naming, languages or waits you changed. Library folders that held titles stay, because the removed titles keep their History, and so do the Pick rules those titles used, without the traits the move made. The next move takes those Pick rules and folders back: the Pick rules get the profile's trait scores again instead of a second set named `(moved)`, and the folder takes the move's default Pick rules. Pick rules you changed after the undo stay as you left them, and the move makes its own.

**Parts.** A part that is off is left out. Movies off: no movie folder, movie or Outside list. Subtitles off: no subtitle setting. Requests off: no requests.

**Safe mode.** You can read, choose and try, but not move or undo.

<details class="ha-more"><summary>API</summary>

API keys need the **admin** scope.

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/migrate/plan` | The plan for the picked reads, with counts and suggested path rules. |
| `POST /api/v1/migrate/dry-run` | The test report and its `plan_hash`. Nothing changes. A person who needs a choice has `choose` set to `same_name`, `numeric_id` or `merge_gone`. |
| `POST /api/v1/migrate/moves` | Starts a move. Needs the test's `plan_hash`. Answers `409` when the plan changed. |
| `GET /api/v1/migrate/moves` | Lists moves, newest first. |
| `GET /api/v1/migrate/moves/{id}` | One move, its report and progress. |
| `GET /api/v1/migrate/moves/{id}/report` | The report as a Markdown file. |
| `POST /api/v1/migrate/moves/{id}/undo` | Queues the undo (`202`). Follow it with `GET /api/v1/migrate/moves/{id}`. |

Body of plan, dry-run and moves (moves also take `"plan_hash"`):

```json
{
  "snapshots": [1, 2],
  "path_rules": [{"from": "/data/media/movies", "to": "/movies"}],
  "skip": ["alerts"],
  "people": {"person:seerr:1": "owner", "person:seerr:3": "admin", "person:seerr:2": "merge"}
}
```

A person choice is `owner` (old app's owner only), `admin`, `merge` or `skip`. Groups you can skip: `folders`, `pick_rules`, `titles`, `never_add`, `outside_lists`, `sources`, `downloaders`, `naming`, `subtitles`, `people`, `wishlist`, `alerts`.
