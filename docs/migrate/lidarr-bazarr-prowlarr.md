Move your music, subtitle languages, Sources and Downloaders. The steps match [Move from other apps](index.md); this page lists what each app brings.

## Move them

1. Open **Settings > Move from other apps** and click **Add an app** for each app.
2. Type the address and API key, or the backup path, and click **Check connection**. For qBittorrent, type the user name and password, or its API key on version 5.2 and later.
3. Read each app, then go through **Choose**, **Try it** and **Move**. You should see each app's groups in **Choose**.

## Lidarr

| From Lidarr | In HolyArrs |
| --- | --- |
| Library folders | Library folders for music. |
| Artists | Titles, matched by MusicBrainz id, folders and files in place. A watched artist gets **Keep up to date**. Nothing is searched for. |
| Quality profiles | The closest **Pick rules** preset (Lossless first, Lossy 320 or V0, Any music). |
| Exclusions | The **Never-add** list. |
| Untagged default wait rule | Waits on the matched Pick rules, up to 7 days. |
| Indexers, download clients, remote path mappings, naming, notifications | Same as for [Sonarr and Radarr](sonarr-radarr.md#what-comes-over). |

Stays behind: metadata profiles, import lists for music, custom formats, release word rules and tags.

## Bazarr

| From Bazarr | In HolyArrs |
| --- | --- |
| Default language profile | Default subtitle languages. |
| Podnapisi and Gestdown | **Subtitle sites**, one of each kind. A kind already here is left alone. |

Stays behind: other subtitle sites and their accounts. HolyArrs reaches Addic7ed through Gestdown with no account, so add Gestdown under **Settings > Subtitles**. For a site with an account, type it there or use [Import keys from a file](import-secrets.md).

## Prowlarr

| From Prowlarr | In HolyArrs |
| --- | --- |
| Torznab, Newznab and RSS indexers | **Sources**, added paused and blocked from your home network. |
| IPTorrents, Knaben, SubsPlease and TorrentsCSV | **Sources** HolyArrs reads straight from the site, added paused. IPTorrents keeps its user agent and freeleech choice; paste its cookie again under **Settings > Sources**. |
| Download clients | **Downloaders**, added paused. |

Stays behind: app links, sync profiles, indexer proxies, notification kinds HolyArrs does not have, and other site definitions. Reach those sites through the Sources bridge.

When you move Sonarr or Radarr in the same move, the copies Prowlarr put there, named like `IPTorrents (Prowlarr)`, are not moved a second time.

:::tip
To keep Prowlarr running and let it push Sources into HolyArrs instead, see [Old-app API](../reference/old-app-api.md).
:::

## qBittorrent and SABnzbd

| From | In HolyArrs |
| --- | --- |
| qBittorrent, SABnzbd | A **Downloader**, added paused, using the `holyarrs` category so it never picks up the old apps' downloads. |

Stays behind: download categories and SABnzbd's usenet servers.

## Before you turn things on

Type each key again and resume each item. See [After the move](index.md#after-the-move).

## If it does not work

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| qBittorrent read fails | Wrong user name or password, or the key on a version before 5.2. | Use the user name and password from qBittorrent's Web UI settings. |
| A Downloader at home does not answer | **May reach the local network** is off. | Turn it on for that Downloader. |
| A subtitle site is off | It needs an account, which a move cannot bring. | Type the account under **Settings > Subtitles**, then turn it on. |
